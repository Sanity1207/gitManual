1. how to use github

set a github repository.

add the link to the remote repository as the keyword 'origin' by typing
	git remote add origin <repositoryURL>

set the target branch to main
	git branch -M main

push the contents from the local repo to the cloud
	git push -u origin main

you can see that the origin is the cloud, and main is the local repo.
so the command would be like git push -u <cloud> <local>
