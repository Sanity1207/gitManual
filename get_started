1. What is git?
File version tracking system.
used to track files in a specific repository. (plus the changes and the information about the changes made to them)

2. Get started
install git (brew install git)
and sign in to git (set your username and email)
	git config --global user.name ""
	git config --global user.email ""
to check your email and username, type in
	git config --list

to receive help in configurating git, type
	git help config

3. Adding files to git
adding files to git means 'having git track the file'
	git add . 
(. means all files)
you can also 'untrack' files after you add them using
	git rm --cached <filename>
you can remove files from staging area.
	


4. gitignore
ignores files (does not add them to git)
create file named 'gitignore' and type in things to ignore
ex)
	#ignore .txt
	*.txt
(same as linux language)

5. commit
committing files to git means 'making an entry in the history book',
'saving the snapshot of the CURRENT repository'

there are three different environments in git
	working files : you actually make changes to files here
	staging : you stage the current snapshot of the change, and they are ready to commit.

you can add and commit at the same time using 
	git commit -a -m "<message>"
