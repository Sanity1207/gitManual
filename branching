1. branching

We use this when we want to make changes, but never permanently add those changes.

2. basics

to see what branch I am in, type
	git branch

to make a new branch, type
	git branch <newbranchname>
or
	git switch -c <newbranchname>


3. using branching
you can commit to your new branch. 
when you do so, it only changes the branch repo, not the original (main) one.

in order to change the main one, you need to merge.

4. merging.
to merge, come back to the branch you want to merge it with (main), and type
	git merge -m "<mergemessage>" <mergebranchname>
if there is a conflict, resolve it and do it again.
